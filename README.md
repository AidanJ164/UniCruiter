## Product Vision
For Recruiters who want to make valuable connections in campus recruiting efforts, UniCruiter is a platform that gives hiring companies early visibility to top-quality students before attending a career fair.  UniCruiter focuses on giving Recruiters the ability to target and track student candidates, unlike Handshake.  UniCruiter will give Recruiters the ability to enrich their interactions with students during campus visits.
